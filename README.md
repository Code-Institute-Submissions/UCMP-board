The Home page hero image is to show professionalism, while the text box explains exactly what product is on offer.

After the special hero image is some further features of the product which reassures the user to the professionalism of the product and provides them further details of what benefit the product could have for them.

Finally there is a simple call to action button in the footer guiding the user to the contact page in order to for them to initiate contact.

The main section details out further information about the product and provides screenshots of the software so the consumer can know what to expect.

At the bottom of the page (above the footer) are the values of the company. These short briefs are to engage to user with qualities the business has.

##### Contact

The [Contact page](https://github.com/Verga1/UCMP-board/blob/master/wireframe/contact.jpg) features a contact form, which requests client name and information request, and below that a box to leave a message with any further enquiry.
